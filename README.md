# Machine-Learning-Classification-Project
One of the greatest challenges faced by service companies is to retain its customers. More customers
means more business and revenue to the company. The cost involved in targeting new customers is a
lot more than the effort to retain the existing ones. Keeping this in mind, companies (that also includes
banks) try to get some insights into the customer data to identify those customers who are likely to leave (churn).
Companies employ lots of techniques to retain their existing customers viz: loyalty programs, better discount rates, priority services, etc. The advantage of using these techniques is to determine what
causes the churn and how it can be reduced in today’s highly competitive market.

# Business Objective
● Build a predictive model to determine which customers are likely to churn (leave the bank).
● Given a set of customer record, determine the probabilities of churn for each customer.
